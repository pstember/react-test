# MDC Rules Organization: Centralized Rule Management

**THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE CRITICAL!**

They ensure consistent organization and maintainability of all Cursor IDE AI MDC rules.

## Rule Creation Protocol

When creating new MDC rules or modifying existing ones, **ALWAYS** follow these guidelines:

### File Location
- **Create all new MDC rules** in the `.cursor/rules/` directory
- **Each rule should be a separate file** with a descriptive filename
- **Use kebab-case** for filenames (e.g., `component-naming.mdc`, `api-standards.mdc`)

### File Naming Convention
- Use descriptive, action-oriented names
- Include the primary purpose in the filename
- Examples:
  - `development-workflow.mdc` - Main development process
  - `component-standards.mdc` - Vue component guidelines
  - `api-conventions.mdc` - API design rules
  - `testing-requirements.mdc` - Testing standards

### File Structure Template
Each MDC rule file should follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Rule Name]: [Brief Description]

## Rule Management

### Creating New Rules
1. **Always create in `.cursor/rules/`** - never in other directories
2. **Use separate files** - don't combine multiple rules in one file
3. **Follow the template structure** above
4. **Reference existing rules** for consistency in style and format

### Updating Existing Rules
1. **Modify the specific rule file** directly
2. **Maintain the established structure** and formatting
3. **Update any cross-references** to other rules if needed

### Rule Discovery
- **Check `.cursor/rules/` first** when looking for existing rules
- **Use descriptive filenames** to make rules easy to find
- **Consider creating an index file** if the number of rules grows significantly

## File Organization

```
.cursor/
├── rules/
│   ├── development-workflow.mdc     # Main development process
│   ├── mdc-rules-organization.mdc   # This file - rule management
│   ├── component-standards.mdc      # Vue component guidelines
│   ├── api-conventions.mdc          # API design rules
│   ├── testing-requirements.mdc     # Testing standards
│   └── [additional-rules].mdc       # Other specific rules
specs/
└── [feature-specs].md               # Feature specifications
```

## Remember

**Always create new MDC rules in `.cursor/rules/` as separate files with `.mdc` extension. This ensures discoverability, maintainability, and consistent organization across the project.**

*This rule ensures that all Cursor IDE AI MDC rules are properly organized and easily accessible for future reference and updates.*
